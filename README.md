## tiny-timer

microbenchmark tool that calls a function as many times as possible within a fixed time budget (in microseconds). That can be useful for:

    Estimating how "fast" a function is.
    Calibrating work units in time-sensitive loops.
    Quick benchmarking or profiling.
    Scope based time measurement.
